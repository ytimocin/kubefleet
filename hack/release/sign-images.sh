# Sign each published image with cosign, keyless, using the workflow's GitHub
# OIDC identity.
#
# Images are signed by *digest*, read from the build metadata buildx wrote
# during this run. Signing a tag would sign whatever that tag resolves to when
# cosign runs, which is not necessarily what this run pushed - the whole point
# of a signature is to bind it to specific bytes.
#
# The set of images comes from the metadata directory rather than from a list
# passed in, so "everything this run built gets signed" is structurally true. A
# hand-maintained list could drop an image while the job still exited 0,
# publishing an unsigned image that the documentation tells users to verify.
#
# The complementary invariant - that everything a release *should* contain was
# built - is asserted by the multi-arch verification step that runs immediately
# before this script. Keep that ordering: it is what stops a dropped build
# target from being silently absent here.
#
# Environment:
#   REGISTRY            image repository prefix, e.g. ghcr.io/kubefleet-dev/kubefleet
#   IMAGE_METADATA_DIR  directory holding <image>.json from `buildx --metadata-file`
#   GITHUB_REPOSITORY   owner/repo, used to bound the identity on verification
